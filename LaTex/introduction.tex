\section{Introduction}
When studying systems and control theory we often focus on finding properties of a given mathematical model. However, in the real world the mathematical model of a system is not always available. In most cases we only have the measurements/data as produced by a system. To combat this, we can use tools from the field of data-driven analysis and control. These tools are able to infer system theoretical properties from the data without explicitly knowing the underlying mathematical model of the system. In this paper we will look at the implementation of the tools provided in \cite{waarde2019data} and \cite{waarde2020noisy}.
