%\section{Abstract}
In this thesis we deal with implementing the existing data informativity framework into a Matlab toolbox. The toolbox has support for both noiseless data as well as data with bounded noise. In the case of noiseless data there are implementations for system identification, stabilisability, controllability, stability, state feedback, deadbeat control, LQR control, dynamic measurement feedback and state identification. In the case of data with bounded noise there are implementations for quadratic stabilisation, $\mathcal{H}_2$ control and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control.
