\section{Conclusion}
The aim of this project was to implement the methods discussed in the informativity framework from \cite{waarde2019data} and \cite{waarde2020noisy} for computation of system theoretic properties and controller directly from data into Matlab as well as providing documentation for each methods.

This is done by providing a look at how the methods were derived in the documentation as well as providing corresponding functions for each method. This was done for all the methods described in the previously mentioned papers. The documentation also provides examples for each of the methods as well as an example of how the functions can be used for system identification on continuous-time systems using the impulse and step response. 

All these methods are implemented and available at: \\
