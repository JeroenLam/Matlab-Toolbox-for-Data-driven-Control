From paper \textbf{REFERENCE} we have the following theorem.
\thr{Informative for deadbeat control}{
    The data $(U_{-}, X)$ are informative for deadbeat control if and only if the matrix $X_-$ has full row rank and there exists a right inverse \textbf{X-inverse} of $X_+ X_- inverse$ is nilpotent.
    Moreover, if this condition is satisfied then the feedback gain $K := U_- X_- INVERSE$ yields a deadbeat conroller, that is $\Sigma_{i/s} \subseteq \Sigma_K {nil}.

\subsection{Examples:}
The first example we will consider is of a case in which we have that the data is informative for system identification and controllability. We will consider the following system:
\[ \dot x = \begin{bmatrix} 
-6& -11& -6 \\
 1&   0&  0 \\
 0&   1&  0 
\end{bmatrix} x + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} u \]
